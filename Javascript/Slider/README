Project: Creating an Image Carousel/Slider in Javascript

We'll take a break from games to build something that you'll probably create in the real world at some point -- a simple image carousel / slider which cycles through some preloaded images. See the one on eriktrautman.com for the general idea. jssor.com also has one, though yours will not contain any of those fancy transitions.

Though it may seem a bit simple initially, this project will probably make you scratch your head a bit and that's good -- it's a very relevant real-world example of a feature you might be asked to build and you'll have to think your way through to the solution.
